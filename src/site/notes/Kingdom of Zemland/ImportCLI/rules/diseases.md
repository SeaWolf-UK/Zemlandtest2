# Diseases

## Arcane Blight
_Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 233_

Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a [nothic](compendium/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md), but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).

A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: "I don't trust anyone." This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.

Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by `1d6`. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a [nothic](compendium/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md) under the DM's control. Only a [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.

A [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure.

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded).

## Blue Mist Fever
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

A magical mist creeps through the jungles of Chult. Contact with this thin, blue, odorless mist can infect giants and humanoids with blue mist fever. A [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell destroys the mist in a 20-foot square starting at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range. An encounter with this mist typically covers `1d6` such areas (400-2,400 square feet).

A giant or humanoid that comes into contact with the mist must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with blue mist fever. An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys `1d6` hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest `1d4` hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`1d10`) psychic damage and becomes [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by `1d6`. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of [Madness](rules/variant-rules/madness.md).

## Filth Fever
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Flesh Rot
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Mindfire
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](compendium/spells/confusion.md) spell during combat.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Seizure
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

> [!note]

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `1d4` days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

On a successful save, the character's [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Shivering Sickness
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

Insects native to the jungles and marshes of Chult carry this disease, shivering sickness. The easiest protection against it is a coating of insect-repelling salve on all exposed skin (for the cost of insect repellent, see "Buying a Special Item".

A giant or humanoid that takes damage from [insect swarms](compendium/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-insects.md) or from [giant centipedes](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-centipede.md), [giant scorpions](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md), or [giant wasps](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-wasp.md) is exposed to the disease at the end of the encounter. Those who haven't applied insect repellent since their previous long rest are exposed to the disease when they finish a long rest.

A giant or humanoid exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature with natural armor has advantage on the saving throw. It takes `2d6` hours for symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include blurred vision, disorientation, and a sudden drop in body temperature that causes uncontrollable shivering and chattering of the teeth.

Once symptoms begin, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from a long rest. The infected creature also has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. At the end of a long rest, an infected creature repeats the saving throw, shaking off the disease on a successful save.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) until its sight is restored by magic such as [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or [heal](compendium/spells/heal.md).

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an [herbalism kit](compendium/items/herbalism-kit.md) can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Slimy Doom
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](compendium/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Super-Tetanus
_Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 104_

A creature that contracts the disease of super-tetanus is wracked with pain as its heart races and its muscles spasm hard enough to break its bones. The creature takes 11 (`2d10`) damage at the start of each of its turns. If a victim is not cured by other means, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every minute after becoming exposed, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

## Throat Leeches
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After `1d6` hours, the infected character gains 1 level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified.
