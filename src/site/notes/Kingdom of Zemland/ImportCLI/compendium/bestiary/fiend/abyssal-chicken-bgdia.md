# Abyssal Chicken
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus p. 97*  

Abyssal chickens are carnivorous, temperamental, tasty bottom-feeders native to the Abyss. They beat their leathery wings to scare predators and to help them run faster, and they taste like fatty chicken.

With your permission, a character who casts the [find familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar.md) spell can henceforth choose to conjure an abyssal chicken instead of a raven.
