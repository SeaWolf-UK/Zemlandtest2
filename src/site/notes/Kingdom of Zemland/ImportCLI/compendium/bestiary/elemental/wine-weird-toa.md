***Water Bound.*** The wine weird dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.

## Actions

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (`3d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 feet toward the wine weird. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), the wine weird tries to drown it, and the wine weird can't constrict another target.
