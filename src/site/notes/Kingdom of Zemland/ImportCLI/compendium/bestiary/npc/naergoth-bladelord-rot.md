## Traits

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Naergoth has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Naergoth makes three attacks, either with his longsword or longbow. He can use Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`5d6 + 3`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) slashing damage, or 10 (`1d10 + 5`) if used with two hands, plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d8 + 1`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage.
