## Traits

***5etools Note.*** Varram is presented in The Rise of Tiamat as a male dwarf. The [dragonsoul](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/dragonsoul-rot.md) stat block, modified with dwarf racial traits, has been provided here for ease of use.

***Dragon Fanatic.*** Varram has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened). While Varram can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, Varram ignores the effects of being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if Varram makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (`3d6`) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** Varram can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** Varram has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Varram's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Dwarven Resilience.*** Varram
