## Traits

***Aura of Command.*** Hask radiates a commanding presence in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. A draconian in the aura that can see or hear the aurak can't be [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed) and has advantage on saving throws made to avoid or end the [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition on itself.

***Death Throes.*** When Hask is reduced to 0 hit points, its magical essence lashes out as a ball of lightning at the closest creature within 30 feet of it before arcing out to up to two other creatures within 15 feet of the first. Each creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (`2d8`) lightning damage and is [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](rules/conditions.md#stunned).

***Spellcasting.*** Hask casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At will**: [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [mage hand](compendium/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1/day**: [dominate person](compendium/spells/dominate-person.md)

**2/day each**: [dimension door](compendium/spells/dimension-door.md), [disguise self](compendium/spells/disguise-self.md), [sending](compendium/spells/sending.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Hask makes three Rend or Energy Ray attacks.

***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d12 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Energy Ray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) force damage.

***Noxious Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Hask exhales a 15-foot cone of noxious gas. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (`6d6`) poison damage and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, doesn't gain [exhaustion](rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and is immune to all draconians' Noxious Breath for 24 hours.
